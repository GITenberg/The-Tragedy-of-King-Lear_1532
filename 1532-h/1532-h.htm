<p>KENT.<br/>
I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the kingdom, it appears
not which of the Dukes he values most, for qualities are so weighed that
curiosity in neither can make choice of either&rsquo;s moiety.</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
Is not this your son, my lord?
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often
blush&rsquo;d to acknowledge him that now I am braz&rsquo;d to&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
I cannot conceive you.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
Sir, this young fellow&rsquo;s mother could; whereupon she grew
round-wombed, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she
had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than
this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came
something saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was
his mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this noble gentleman,
Edmund?</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
No, my lord.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
My Lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my honourable friend.
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
My services to your lordship.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
I must love you, and sue to know you better.
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
Sir, I shall study deserving.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. The King
is coming.</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Sennet within.</i>]</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Lear, Cornwall, Albany,
Goneril, Regan, Cordelia</span> and Attendants.</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy,<br/>
Gloucester.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
I shall, my lord.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exeunt <span class="charname">Gloucester</span> and <span
class="charname">Edmund</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.<br/>
Give me the map there. Know that we have divided<br/>
In three our kingdom: and &rsquo;tis our fast intent<br/>
To shake all cares and business from our age;<br/>
Conferring them on younger strengths, while we<br/>
Unburden&rsquo;d crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,<br/>
And you, our no less loving son of Albany,<br/>
We have this hour a constant will to publish<br/>
Our daughters&rsquo; several dowers, that future strife<br/>
May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,<br/>
Great rivals in our youngest daughter&rsquo;s love,<br/>
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,<br/>
And here are to be answer&rsquo;d. Tell me, my daughters,&mdash;<br/>
Since now we will divest us both of rule,<br/>
Interest of territory, cares of state,&mdash;<br/>
Which of you shall we say doth love us most?<br/>
That we our largest bounty may extend<br/>
Where nature doth with merit challenge.&mdash;Goneril,<br/>
Our eldest born, speak first.
</p>

<p>GONERIL.<br/>
Sir, I love you more than word can wield the matter;<br/>
Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;<br/>
Beyond what can be valu&rsquo;d, rich or rare;<br/>
No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;<br/>
As much as child e&rsquo;er lov&rsquo;d, or father found;<br/>
A love that makes breath poor and speech unable;<br/>
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
</p>

<p>CORDELIA.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,<br/>
With shadowy forests and with champains rich&rsquo;d,<br/>
With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,<br/>
We make thee lady: to thine and Albany&rsquo;s issue<br/>
Be this perpetual.&mdash;What says our second daughter,<br/>
Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak.
</p>

<p>REGAN.<br/>
Sir, I am made of the self mettle as my sister,<br/>
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart<br/>
I find she names my very deed of love;<br/>
Only she comes too short, that I profess<br/>
Myself an enemy to all other joys<br/>
Which the most precious square of sense possesses,<br/>
And find I am alone felicitate<br/>
In your dear highness&rsquo; love.
</p>

<p>CORDELIA.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] Then poor Cordelia,<br/>
And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love&rsquo;s<br/>
More ponderous than my tongue.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
To thee and thine hereditary ever<br/>
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;<br/>
No less in space, validity, and pleasure<br/>
Than that conferr&rsquo;d on Goneril.&mdash;Now, our joy,<br/>
Although the last and least; to whose young love<br/>
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy<br/>
Strive to be interess&rsquo;d; what can you say to draw<br/>
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
</p>

<p>CORDELIA.<br/>
Nothing, my lord.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Nothing?
</p>

<p>CORDELIA.<br/>
Nothing.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.
</p>

<p>CORDELIA.<br/>
Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave<br/>
My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty<br/>
According to my bond; no more nor less.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,<br/>
Lest you may mar your fortunes.
</p>

<p>CORDELIA.<br/>
Good my lord,<br/>
You have begot me, bred me, lov&rsquo;d me: I<br/>
Return those duties back as are right fit,<br/>
Obey you, love you, and most honour you.<br/>
Why have my sisters husbands if they say<br/>
They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,<br/>
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry<br/>
Half my love with him, half my care and duty:<br/>
Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,<br/>
To love my father all.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
But goes thy heart with this?
</p>

<p>CORDELIA.<br/>
Ay, my good lord.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
So young, and so untender?
</p>

<p>CORDELIA.<br/>
So young, my lord, and true.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Let it be so, thy truth then be thy dower:<br/>
For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,<br/>
The mysteries of Hecate and the night;<br/>
By all the operation of the orbs,<br/>
From whom we do exist and cease to be;<br/>
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,<br/>
Propinquity and property of blood,<br/>
And as a stranger to my heart and me<br/>
Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,<br/>
Or he that makes his generation messes<br/>
To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom<br/>
Be as well neighbour&rsquo;d, pitied, and reliev&rsquo;d,<br/>
As thou my sometime daughter.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
Good my liege,&mdash;
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Peace, Kent!<br/>
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.<br/>
I lov&rsquo;d her most, and thought to set my rest<br/>
On her kind nursery. [<i>To Cordelia.</i>] Hence and avoid my sight!<br/>
So be my grave my peace, as here I give<br/>
Her father&rsquo;s heart from her! Call France. Who stirs?<br/>
Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,<br/>
With my two daughters&rsquo; dowers digest this third:<br/>
Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.<br/>
I do invest you jointly with my power,<br/>
Pre-eminence, and all the large effects<br/>
That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,<br/>
With reservation of an hundred knights,<br/>
By you to be sustain&rsquo;d, shall our abode<br/>
Make with you by due turn. Only we shall retain<br/>
The name, and all the addition to a king; the sway,<br/>
Revenue, execution of the rest,<br/>
Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,<br/>
This coronet part between you.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Giving the crown.</i>]</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
Royal Lear,<br/>
Whom I have ever honour&rsquo;d as my king,<br/>
Lov&rsquo;d as my father, as my master follow&rsquo;d,<br/>
As my great patron thought on in my prayers.&mdash;
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
Let it fall rather, though the fork invade<br/>
The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly<br/>
When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?<br/>
Think&rsquo;st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,<br/>
When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour&rsquo;s bound<br/>
When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy state;<br/>
And in thy best consideration check<br/>
This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgement,<br/>
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;<br/>
Nor are those empty-hearted, whose low sounds<br/>
Reverb no hollowness.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Kent, on thy life, no more.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
My life I never held but as a pawn<br/>
To wage against thine enemies; ne&rsquo;er fear to lose it,<br/>
Thy safety being the motive.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Out of my sight!
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
See better, Lear; and let me still remain<br/>
The true blank of thine eye.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Now, by Apollo,&mdash;
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
Now by Apollo, King,<br/>
Thou swear&rsquo;st thy gods in vain.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
O vassal! Miscreant!
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Laying his hand on his sword.</i>]</p>

<p>ALBANY and CORNWALL.<br/>
Dear sir, forbear!
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow<br/>
Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,<br/>
Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,<br/>
I&rsquo;ll tell thee thou dost evil.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Hear me, recreant! on thine allegiance, hear me!<br/>
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vows,<br/>
Which we durst never yet, and with strain&rsquo;d pride<br/>
To come betwixt our sentences and our power,<br/>
Which nor our nature, nor our place can bear,<br/>
Our potency made good, take thy reward.<br/>
Five days we do allot thee for provision,<br/>
To shield thee from disasters of the world;<br/>
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back<br/>
Upon our kingdom: if, on the next day following,<br/>
Thy banish&rsquo;d trunk be found in our dominions,<br/>
The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,<br/>
This shall not be revok&rsquo;d.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
Fare thee well, King: sith thus thou wilt appear,<br/>
Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.<br/>
[<i>To Cordelia.</i>] The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,<br/>
That justly think&rsquo;st and hast most rightly said!<br/>
[<i>To Goneril and Regan.</i>] And your large speeches may your deeds
approve,<br/>
That good effects may spring from words of love.<br/>
Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;<br/>
He&rsquo;ll shape his old course in a country new.

<p>CORDELIA.<br/>
Here&rsquo;s France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
My Lord of Burgundy,<br/>
We first address toward you, who with this king<br/>
Hath rivall&rsquo;d for our daughter: what in the least<br/>
Will you require in present dower with her,<br/>
Or cease your quest of love?
</p>

<p>BURGUNDY.<br/>
Most royal majesty,<br/>
I crave no more than hath your highness offer&rsquo;d,<br/>
Nor will you tender less?
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Right noble Burgundy,<br/>
When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;<br/>
But now her price is fall&rsquo;n. Sir, there she stands:<br/>
If aught within that little-seeming substance,<br/>
Or all of it, with our displeasure piec&rsquo;d,<br/>
And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,<br/>
She&rsquo;s there, and she is yours.
</p>

<p>BURGUNDY.<br/>
I know no answer.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Will you, with those infirmities she owes,<br/>
Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,<br/>
Dower&rsquo;d with our curse, and stranger&rsquo;d with our oath,<br/>
Take her or leave her?
</p>

<p>BURGUNDY.<br/>
Pardon me, royal sir;<br/>
Election makes not up in such conditions.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,<br/>
I tell you all her wealth. [<i>To France</i>] For you, great king,<br/>
I would not from your love make such a stray<br/>
To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you<br/>
T&rsquo;avert your liking a more worthier way<br/>
Than on a wretch whom nature is asham&rsquo;d<br/>
Almost t&rsquo;acknowledge hers.
</p>

<p>FRANCE.<br/>
This is most strange,<br/>
That she, who even but now was your best object,<br/>
The argument of your praise, balm of your age,<br/>
The best, the dearest, should in this trice of time<br/>
Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle<br/>
So many folds of favour. Sure her offence<br/>
Must be of such unnatural degree<br/>
That monsters it, or your fore-vouch&rsquo;d affection<br/>
Fall into taint; which to believe of her<br/>
Must be a faith that reason without miracle<br/>
Should never plant in me.
</p>

<p>CORDELIA.<br/>
I yet beseech your majesty,<br/>
If for I want that glib and oily art<br/>
To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,<br/>
I&rsquo;ll do&rsquo;t before I speak,&mdash;that you make known<br/>
It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,<br/>
No unchaste action or dishonour&rsquo;d step,<br/>
That hath depriv&rsquo;d me of your grace and favour;<br/>
But even for want of that for which I am richer,<br/>
A still soliciting eye, and such a tongue<br/>
As I am glad I have not, though not to have it<br/>
Hath lost me in your liking.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Better thou hadst<br/>
Not been born than not to have pleas&rsquo;d me better.
</p>

<p>FRANCE.<br/>
Is it but this?&mdash;a tardiness in nature<br/>
Which often leaves the history unspoke<br/>
That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,<br/>
What say you to the lady? Love&rsquo;s not love<br/>
When it is mingled with regards that stands<br/>
Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?<br/>
She is herself a dowry.
</p>

<p>BURGUNDY.<br/>
Royal King,<br/>
Give but that portion which yourself propos&rsquo;d,<br/>
And here I take Cordelia by the hand,<br/>
Duchess of Burgundy.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.
</p>

<p>BURGUNDY.<br/>
I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father<br/>
That you must lose a husband.
</p>

<p>CORDELIA.<br/>
Peace be with Burgundy!<br/>
Since that respects of fortunes are his love,<br/>
I shall not be his wife.
</p>

<p>FRANCE.<br/>
Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;<br/>
Most choice forsaken; and most lov&rsquo;d, despis&rsquo;d!<br/>
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:<br/>
Be it lawful, I take up what&rsquo;s cast away.<br/>
Gods, gods! &rsquo;Tis strange that from their cold&rsquo;st neglect<br/>
My love should kindle to inflam&rsquo;d respect.<br/>
Thy dowerless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,<br/>
Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:<br/>
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy<br/>
Can buy this unpriz&rsquo;d precious maid of me.<br/>
Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:<br/>
Thou losest here, a better where to find.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we<br/>
Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see<br/>
That face of hers again. Therefore be gone<br/>
Without our grace, our love, our benison.<br/>
Come, noble Burgundy.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Flourish. Exeunt <span class="charname">Lear, Burgundy,

<p>FRANCE.<br/>
Bid farewell to your sisters.
</p>

<p>CORDELIA.<br/>
The jewels of our father, with wash&rsquo;d eyes<br/>

<p>GONERIL.<br/>
Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly
appertains to us both. I think our father will hence tonight.</p>

<p>REGAN.<br/>
That&rsquo;s most certain, and with you; next month with us.
</p>

<p>GONERIL.<br/>
You see how full of changes his age is; the observation we
have made of it hath not been little: he always loved our
sister most; and with what poor judgement he hath now cast her
off appears too grossly.</p>

<p>REGAN.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever but slenderly
known himself.</p>

<p>GONERIL.<br/>
The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then must
we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of
long-engrafted condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness
that infirm and choleric years bring with them.</p>

<p>REGAN.<br/>
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent&rsquo;s
banishment.
</p>

<p>GONERIL.<br/>
There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and
him. Pray you let us hit together: if our father carry authority
with such disposition as he bears, this last surrender of his
will but offend us.</p>

<p>REGAN.<br/>
We shall further think of it.
</p>

<p>GONERIL.<br/>
We must do something, and i&rsquo; th&rsquo; heat.

Nothing, my lord.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? The
quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself. Let&rsquo;s see. Come, if
it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother that I have not
all o&rsquo;er-read; and for so much as I have perus&rsquo;d, I find it not fit
for your o&rsquo;er-looking.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
Give me the letter, sir.
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents, as in

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
Let&rsquo;s see, let&rsquo;s see!
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
I hope, for my brother&rsquo;s justification, he wrote this but as an
essay, or taste of my virtue.</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
[<i>Reads.</i>] &lsquo;This policy and reverence of age makes the world
bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us
till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle
and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways
not as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to me, that
of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I
waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live
the beloved of your brother EDGAR.&rsquo;<br/>
Hum! Conspiracy? &lsquo;Sleep till I wake him, you should enjoy half
his revenue.&rsquo;&mdash;My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? A heart
and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought it?</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
It was not brought me, my lord, there&rsquo;s the cunning of it. I
found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
You know the character to be your brother&rsquo;s?
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but
in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
It is his.
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the
contents.</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
Has he never before sounded you in this business?
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit
that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declined, the father
should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred
villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than
brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him; I&rsquo;ll apprehend him. Abominable
villain, Where is he?</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend
your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him
better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course;
where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his
purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour, and shake
in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
for him, that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your
honour, and to no other pretence of danger.</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
Think you so?
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall hear us
confer of this, and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction,
and that without any further delay than this very evening.</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
He cannot be such a monster.
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
Nor is not, sure.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him. Heaven
and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray you:
frame the business after your own wisdom. I would unstate myself
to be in a due resolution.</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I shall
find means, and acquaint you withal.</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us:
though the wisdom of Nature can reason it thus and thus, yet
nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools,
friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in
countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond cracked
&rsquo;twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the
prediction; there&rsquo;s son against father: the King falls from
bias of nature; there&rsquo;s father against child. We have seen the
best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out
this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it
carefully.&mdash;And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his
offence, honesty! &rsquo;Tis strange.</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are
sick in fortune, often the surfeits of our own behaviour, we
make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as
if we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;
knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance;
drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of
planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine
thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his
goatish disposition to the charge of a star. My father compounded
with my mother under the dragon&rsquo;s tail, and my nativity was under
Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut! I
should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the
firmament twinkled on my bastardizing.</p>

these eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la, mi.</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
How now, brother Edmund, what serious contemplation are you in?
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day,
what should follow these eclipses.</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Do you busy yourself with that?
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as of
unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death, dearth,
dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and
maledictions against King and nobles; needless diffidences,
banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches,
and I know not what.</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
How long have you been a sectary astronomical?
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
Come, come! when saw you my father last?
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
The night gone by.
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
Spake you with him?
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Ay, two hours together.
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him, by word
nor countenance?</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
None at all.
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him: and at my
entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath
qualified the heat of his displeasure; which at this instant so
rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would
scarcely allay.</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Some villain hath done me wrong.
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
That&rsquo;s my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance till the
speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me to
my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord
speak: pray ye, go; there&rsquo;s my key. If you do stir abroad, go
armed.</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Armed, brother?

if there be any good meaning toward you: I have told you what I
have seen and heard. But faintly; nothing like the image and
horror of it: pray you, away!</p>

Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,<br/>
Wherein we must have use of your advice.<br/>
Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,<br/>
Of differences, which I best thought it fit<br/>
To answer from our home; the several messengers<br/>

Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow<br/>
Your needful counsel to our business,<br/>
Which craves the instant use.

I love thee not.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
Fellow, I know thee.
</p>

<p>OSWALD.<br/>
What dost thou know me for?
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud,
shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy,
worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking, whoreson,
glass-gazing, super-serviceable, finical rogue;
one trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of
good service, and art nothing but the composition of a
knave, beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel
bitch: one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou
deniest the least syllable of thy addition.</p>

Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one that&rsquo;s
neither known of thee nor knows thee?</p>

What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me! Is
it two days ago since I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before
the King? Draw, you rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon

What is your difference? Speak.
</p>

<p>OSWALD.<br/>
I am scarce in breath, my lord.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
No marvel, you have so bestirr&rsquo;d your valour. You cowardly
rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee.</p>

<p>CORNWALL.<br/>
Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?

You beastly knave, know you no reverence?
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.
</p>

<p>CORNWALL.<br/>
Why art thou angry?
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
That such a slave as this should wear a sword,<br/>
Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,<br/>
Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain<br/>
Which are too intrince t&rsquo;unloose; smooth every passion<br/>
That in the natures of their lords rebel;<br/>
Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;<br/>
Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks<br/>
With every gale and vary of their masters,<br/>
Knowing naught, like dogs, but following.<br/>
A plague upon your epileptic visage!<br/>
Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?<br/>
Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,<br/>
I&rsquo;d drive ye cackling home to Camelot.
</p>

What, art thou mad, old fellow?
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
How fell you out? Say that.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
No contraries hold more antipathy<br/>
Than I and such a knave.
</p>

<p>CORNWALL.<br/>
Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
His countenance likes me not.
</p>

<p>CORNWALL.<br/>
No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
Sir, &rsquo;tis my occupation to be plain:<br/>
I have seen better faces in my time<br/>
Than stands on any shoulder that I see<br/>
Before me at this instant.
</p>

<p>CORNWALL.<br/>
This is some fellow<br/>
Who, having been prais&rsquo;d for bluntness, doth affect<br/>
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb<br/>
Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,<br/>
An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!<br/>
An they will take it, so; if not, he&rsquo;s plain.<br/>
These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness<br/>
Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends<br/>
Than twenty silly-ducking observants<br/>
That stretch their duties nicely.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,<br/>
Under th&rsquo;allowance of your great aspect,<br/>
Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire<br/>
On flickering Phoebus&rsquo; front,&mdash;
</p>

<p>CORNWALL.<br/>
What mean&rsquo;st by this?
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I know,
sir, I am no flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain accent
was a plain knave; which, for my part, I will not be, though I
should win your displeasure to entreat me to&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>CORNWALL.<br/>
What was the offence you gave him?
</p>

<p>OSWALD.<br/>
I never gave him any:<br/>
It pleas&rsquo;d the King his master very late<br/>
To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;<br/>
When he, compact, and flattering his displeasure,<br/>
Tripp&rsquo;d me behind; being down, insulted, rail&rsquo;d<br/>
And put upon him such a deal of man,<br/>
That worthied him, got praises of the King<br/>
For him attempting who was self-subdu&rsquo;d;<br/>
And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,<br/>
Drew on me here again.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
None of these rogues and cowards<br/>
But Ajax is their fool.
</p>

<p>CORNWALL.<br/>
Fetch forth the stocks!<br/>
You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,<br/>
We&rsquo;ll teach you.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
Sir, I am too old to learn:<br/>
Call not your stocks for me: I serve the King;<br/>
On whose employment I was sent to you:<br/>
You shall do small respect, show too bold malice<br/>
Against the grace and person of my master,<br/>

Let me beseech your grace not to do so:<br/>

Is such as basest and contemned&rsquo;st wretches<br/>

That he, so slightly valued in his messenger,<br/>
Should have him thus restrained.
</p>

I&rsquo;ll answer that.

[<i>Kneeling.</i>]<br/>
Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg<br/>
That you&rsquo;ll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.&rsquo;

<p>REGAN.<br/>
Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks:<br/>
Return you to my sister.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
[<i>Rising.</i>] Never, Regan:<br/>
She hath abated me of half my train;<br/>
Look&rsquo;d black upon me; struck me with her tongue,<br/>
Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.<br/>
All the stor&rsquo;d vengeances of heaven fall<br/>
On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,<br/>
You taking airs, with lameness!
</p>

<p>CORNWALL.<br/>
Fie, sir, fie!
</p>

You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames<br/>

</p>

<p>REGAN.<br/>
O the blest gods!<br/>
So will you wish on me when the rash mood is on.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.<br/>
Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give<br/>
Thee o&rsquo;er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine<br/>
Do comfort, and not burn. &rsquo;Tis not in thee<br/>
To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,<br/>
To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,<br/>
And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt<br/>
Against my coming in. Thou better know&rsquo;st<br/>
The offices of nature, bond of childhood,<br/>
Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;<br/>
Thy half o&rsquo; the kingdom hast thou not forgot,<br/>
Wherein I thee endow&rsquo;d.

I am now from home, and out of that provision<br/>
Which shall be needful for your entertainment.

Return to her, and fifty men dismiss&rsquo;d?<br/>
No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose<br/>
To wage against the enmity o&rsquo; the air;<br/>
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,<br/>
Necessity&rsquo;s sharp pinch! Return with her?<br/>
Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took<br/>
Our youngest born, I could as well be brought<br/>
To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg<br/>
To keep base life afoot. Return with her?<br/>
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter<br/>
To this detested groom.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Pointing to Oswald.</i>]</p>

I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:<br/>
We&rsquo;ll no more meet, no more see one another.<br/>
But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;<br/>
Or rather a disease that&rsquo;s in my flesh,<br/>
Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,<br/>
A plague sore, or embossed carbuncle<br/>
In my corrupted blood. But I&rsquo;ll not chide thee;<br/>
Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:<br/>
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,<br/>

Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:<br/>
I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,<br/>
I and my hundred knights.
</p>

<p>REGAN.<br/>
Not altogether so,<br/>
I look&rsquo;d not for you yet, nor am provided<br/>
For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;<br/>
For those that mingle reason with your passion<br/>
Must be content to think you old, and so&mdash;<br/>

Is this well spoken?
</p>

<p>REGAN.<br/>
I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?<br/>
Is it not well? What should you need of more?<br/>
Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger<br/>
Speak &rsquo;gainst so great a number? How in one house<br/>
Should many people, under two commands,<br/>
Hold amity? &rsquo;Tis hard; almost impossible.
</p>

<p>GONERIL.<br/>
Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance<br/>
From those that she calls servants, or from mine?
</p>

<p>REGAN.<br/>
Why not, my lord? If then they chanc&rsquo;d to slack ye,<br/>
We could control them. If you will come to me,&mdash;<br/>
For now I spy a danger,&mdash;I entreat you<br/>
To bring but five-and-twenty: to no more<br/>

Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour&rsquo;d<br/>
When others are more wicked; not being the worst<br/>
Stands in some rank of praise.<br/>

Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,<br/>
And thou art twice her love.

<p>GONERIL.<br/>
Hear me, my lord:<br/>
What need you five-and-twenty? Ten? Or five?<br/>
To follow in a house where twice so many<br/>
Have a command to tend you?
</p>

<p>REGAN.<br/>
What need one?
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
O, reason not the need: our basest beggars<br/>
Are in the poorest thing superfluous:<br/>
Allow not nature more than nature needs,<br/>
Man&rsquo;s life is cheap as beast&rsquo;s. Thou art a lady;<br/>
If only to go warm were gorgeous,<br/>
Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear&rsquo;st<br/>
Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,&mdash;<br/>
You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!<br/>
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,<br/>
As full of grief as age; wretched in both!<br/>
If it be you that stirs these daughters&rsquo; hearts<br/>
Against their father, fool me not so much<br/>
To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,<br/>
And let not women&rsquo;s weapons, water-drops,<br/>
Stain my man&rsquo;s cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,<br/>
I will have such revenges on you both<br/>
That all the world shall,&mdash;I will do such things,&mdash;<br/>
What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be<br/>
The terrors of the earth. You think I&rsquo;ll weep;<br/>
No, I&rsquo;ll not weep:&mdash; [<i>Storm and tempest.</i>]<br/>

<p class="scenedesc"> A storm with thunder and lightning. Enter <span

severally.</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
Who&rsquo;s there, besides foul weather?

One minded like the weather, most unquietly.

I know you. Where&rsquo;s the King?

Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,<br/>
Or swell the curled waters &rsquo;bove the main,<br/>
That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,<br/>

Catch in their fury and make nothing of;<br/>
Strives in his little world of man to outscorn<br/>
The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.<br/>

The lion and the belly-pinched wolf<br/>
Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,<br/>

Sir, I do know you;<br/>
And dare, upon the warrant of my note<br/>
Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,<br/>
Although as yet the face of it be cover&rsquo;d<br/>
With mutual cunning, &rsquo;twixt Albany and Cornwall;<br/>
Who have, as who have not, that their great stars<br/>
Throne&rsquo;d and set high; servants, who seem no less,<br/>
Which are to France the spies and speculations<br/>
Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen,<br/>
Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes;<br/>
Or the hard rein which both of them have borne<br/>
Against the old kind King; or something deeper,<br/>
Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings;&mdash;<br/>
But, true it is, from France there comes a power<br/>
Into this scatter&rsquo;d kingdom; who already,<br/>
Wise in our negligence, have secret feet<br/>
In some of our best ports, and are at point<br/>
To show their open banner.&mdash;Now to you:<br/>
If on my credit you dare build so far<br/>
To make your speed to Dover, you shall find<br/>
Some that will thank you making just report<br/>
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow<br/>
The King hath cause to plain.<br/>
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;<br/>
And from some knowledge and assurance<br/>
Offer this office to you.
</p>

<p>GENTLEMAN.<br/>
I will talk further with you.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
No, do not.<br/>
For confirmation that I am much more<br/>
Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take<br/>
What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,<br/>
As fear not but you shall, show her this ring;<br/>
And she will tell you who your fellow is<br/>
That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!<br/>
I will go seek the King.

in my closet: these injuries the King now bears will be revenged
home; there&rsquo;s part of a power already footed: we must incline to
the King. I will look him, and privily relieve him: go you and
maintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of him
perceived: if he ask for me, I am ill, and gone to bed. If I
die for it, as no less is threatened me, the King my old master

thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothels, thy hand
out of plackets, thy pen from lender&rsquo;s book, and defy the foul

O my good lord, I have been your tenant, and your father&rsquo;s tenant
these fourscore years.

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;<br/>

Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,<br/>

Fellow, where goest?

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
Is it a beggar-man?
</p>

<p>OLD MAN.<br/>
Madman, and beggar too.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
He has some reason, else he could not beg.<br/>
I&rsquo; the last night&rsquo;s storm I such a fellow saw;<br/>
Which made me think a man a worm. My son<br/>
Came then into my mind, and yet my mind<br/>

the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of
lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of darkness; Mahu, of
stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and
mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women. So,
bless thee, master!</p>

Looks fearfully in the confined deep:<br/>

Hasten his musters and conduct his powers.<br/>

Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back, know you no

<p>GENTLEMAN.<br/>
Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his coming

necessary.</p>

</p>

<p>GENTLEMAN.<br/>
Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;<br/>
And now and then an ample tear trill&rsquo;d down<br/>
Her delicate cheek. It seem&rsquo;d she was a queen<br/>
Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,<br/>
Sought to be king o&rsquo;er her.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
O, then it mov&rsquo;d her.
</p>

<p>GENTLEMAN.<br/>
Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove<br/>
Who should express her goodliest. You have seen<br/>
Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears<br/>
Were like a better day. Those happy smilets<br/>
That play&rsquo;d on her ripe lip seem&rsquo;d not to know<br/>
What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence<br/>
As pearls from diamonds dropp&rsquo;d. In brief,<br/>
Sorrow would be a rarity most belov&rsquo;d,<br/>
If all could so become it.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
Made she no verbal question?
</p>

<p>GENTLEMAN.<br/>
Faith, once or twice she heav&rsquo;d the name of &lsquo;father&rsquo;<br/>
Pantingly forth, as if it press&rsquo;d her heart;<br/>
Cried &lsquo;Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!<br/>
Kent! father! sisters! What, i&rsquo; the storm? i&rsquo; the night?<br/>
Let pity not be believ&rsquo;d!&rsquo; There she shook<br/>
The holy water from her heavenly eyes,<br/>
And clamour master&rsquo;d her: then away she started<br/>
To deal with grief alone.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
It is the stars,<br/>
The stars above us govern our conditions;<br/>
Else one self mate and make could not beget<br/>
Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?

No.

A sovereign shame so elbows him. His own unkindness,<br/>
That stripp&rsquo;d her from his benediction, turn&rsquo;d her<br/>
To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights<br/>
To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting<br/>

<p>OSWALD.<br/>
I may not, madam:<br/>
My lady charg&rsquo;d my duty in this business.
</p>

<p>REGAN.<br/>
Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you<br/>
Transport her purposes by word? Belike,<br/>
Somethings, I know not what, I&rsquo;ll love thee much.<br/>
Let me unseal the letter.
</p>

<p>OSWALD.<br/>
Madam, I had rather&mdash;
</p>

<p>REGAN.<br/>
I know your lady does not love her husband;<br/>
I am sure of that; and at her late being here<br/>
She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks<br/>
To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.
</p>

<p>OSWALD.<br/>
I, madam?
</p>

<p>REGAN.<br/>
I speak in understanding; y&rsquo;are, I know&rsquo;t:<br/>
Therefore I do advise you take this note:<br/>
My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk&rsquo;d,<br/>
And more convenient is he for my hand<br/>
Than for your lady&rsquo;s. You may gather more.<br/>
If you do find him, pray you give him this;<br/>
And when your mistress hears thus much from you,<br/>
I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.<br/>
So, fare you well.<br/>
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,<br/>
Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
</p>

<p>OSWALD.<br/>
Would I could meet him, madam! I should show<br/>
What party I do follow.
</p>

<p>REGAN.<br/>
Fare thee well.

When shall I come to the top of that same hill?
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
You do climb up it now. Look how we labour.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
Methinks the ground is even.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Horrible steep.<br/>
Hark, do you hear the sea?
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
No, truly.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect<br/>
By your eyes&rsquo; anguish.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
So may it be indeed.<br/>
Methinks thy voice is alter&rsquo;d; and thou speak&rsquo;st<br/>
In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Y&rsquo;are much deceiv&rsquo;d: in nothing am I chang&rsquo;d<br/>
But in my garments.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
Methinks you&rsquo;re better spoken.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Come on, sir; here&rsquo;s the place. Stand still. How fearful<br/>
And dizzy &rsquo;tis to cast one&rsquo;s eyes so low!<br/>
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air<br/>
Show scarce so gross as beetles. Half way down<br/>
Hangs one that gathers samphire&mdash;dreadful trade!<br/>
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.<br/>
The fishermen that walk upon the beach<br/>
Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,<br/>
Diminish&rsquo;d to her cock; her cock a buoy<br/>
Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge<br/>
That on th&rsquo;unnumber&rsquo;d idle pebble chafes<br/>
Cannot be heard so high. I&rsquo;ll look no more;<br/>
Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight<br/>
Topple down headlong.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
Set me where you stand.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Give me your hand.<br/>
You are now within a foot of th&rsquo;extreme verge.<br/>
For all beneath the moon would I not leap upright.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
Let go my hand.<br/>
Here, friend, &rsquo;s another purse; in it a jewel<br/>
Well worth a poor man&rsquo;s taking. Fairies and gods<br/>
Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off;<br/>
Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Now fare ye well, good sir.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Seems to go.</i>]</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
With all my heart.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] Why I do trifle thus with his despair<br/>
Is done to cure it.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
O you mighty gods!<br/>
This world I do renounce, and in your sights,<br/>
Shake patiently my great affliction off:<br/>
If I could bear it longer, and not fall<br/>
To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,<br/>
My snuff and loathed part of nature should<br/>
Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!<br/>
Now, fellow, fare thee well.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Gone, sir, farewell.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i><span class="charname">Gloucester</span> leaps, and falls

<p>And yet I know not how conceit may rob<br/>
The treasury of life when life itself<br/>
Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,<br/>
By this had thought been past. Alive or dead?<br/>
Ho you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir? speak!<br/>
Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.<br/>
What are you, sir?
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
Away, and let me die.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,<br/>
So many fathom down precipitating,<br/>
Thou&rsquo;dst shiver&rsquo;d like an egg: but thou dost breathe;<br/>
Hast heavy substance; bleed&rsquo;st not; speak&rsquo;st; art sound.<br/>
Ten masts at each make not the altitude<br/>
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.<br/>
Thy life is a miracle. Speak yet again.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
But have I fall&rsquo;n, or no?
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.<br/>
Look up a-height, the shrill-gorg&rsquo;d lark so far<br/>
Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
Alack, I have no eyes.<br/>
Is wretchedness depriv&rsquo;d that benefit<br/>
To end itself by death? &rsquo;Twas yet some comfort<br/>
When misery could beguile the tyrant&rsquo;s rage<br/>
And frustrate his proud will.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Give me your arm.<br/>
Up, so. How is&rsquo;t? Feel you your legs? You stand.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
Too well, too well.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
This is above all strangeness.<br/>
Upon the crown o&rsquo; the cliff what thing was that<br/>
Which parted from you?
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
A poor unfortunate beggar.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
As I stood here below, methought his eyes<br/>
Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,<br/>
Horns whelk&rsquo;d and waved like the enraged sea.<br/>
It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,<br/>
Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours<br/>
Of men&rsquo;s impossibilities, have preserv&rsquo;d thee.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
I do remember now: henceforth I&rsquo;ll bear<br/>
Affliction till it do cry out itself<br/>
&lsquo;Enough, enough,&rsquo; and die. That thing you speak of,<br/>
I took it for a man; often &rsquo;twould say,<br/>
&lsquo;The fiend, the fiend&rsquo;; he led me to that place.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Lear</span>, fantastically
dressed up with flowers.</p>

<p>The safer sense will ne&rsquo;er accommodate<br/>
His master thus.

No, they cannot touch me for coining. I am the King himself.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
O thou side-piercing sight!
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Nature&rsquo;s above art in that respect. There&rsquo;s your press money.
That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper: draw me a clothier&rsquo;s
yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace, this piece of toasted cheese will
do&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s my gauntlet; I&rsquo;ll prove it on a giant.
Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird! i&rsquo; the clout, i&rsquo;
the clout. Hewgh! Give the word.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Sweet marjoram.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Pass.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
I know that voice.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Ha! Goneril with a white beard! They flattered me like a dog; and told
me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say
&lsquo;ay&rsquo; and &lsquo;no&rsquo; to everything I said &lsquo;ay&rsquo;
and &lsquo;no&rsquo; to was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet
me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not
peace at my bidding; there I found &rsquo;em, there I smelt &rsquo;em out.
Go to, they are not men o&rsquo; their words: they told me I was everything;
&rsquo;tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
The trick of that voice I do well remember:<br/>
Is&rsquo;t not the King?
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Ay, every inch a king.<br/>
When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.<br/>
I pardon that man&rsquo;s life. What was thy cause?<br/>
Adultery? Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:<br/>
The wren goes to&rsquo;t, and the small gilded fly<br/>
Does lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive;<br/>
For Gloucester&rsquo;s bastard son was kinder to his father<br/>
Than my daughters got &rsquo;tween the lawful sheets.<br/>
To&rsquo;t, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.<br/>
Behold yond simp&rsquo;ring dame,<br/>
Whose face between her forks presages snow;<br/>
That minces virtue, and does shake the head<br/>
To hear of pleasure&rsquo;s name.<br/>
The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to&rsquo;t with a more riotous appetite.
Down from the waist they are centaurs, though women all above. But to the girdle
do the gods inherit, beneath is all the fiend&rsquo;s; there&rsquo;s hell,
there&rsquo;s darkness, there is the sulphurous pit; burning, scalding, stench,
consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good
apothecary, to sweeten my imagination. There&rsquo;s money for thee.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
O, let me kiss that hand!
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
O ruin&rsquo;d piece of nature, this great world<br/>
Shall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me?<br/>
No, do thy worst, blind Cupid; I&rsquo;ll not love.<br/>
Read thou this challenge; mark but the penning of it.
</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
I would not take this from report,<br/>
It is, and my heart breaks at it.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>

</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
What, with the case of eyes?
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no money
in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a
light, yet you see how this world goes.</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
I see it feelingly.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no eyes.
Look with thine ears. See how yon justice rails upon yon simple
thief. Hark, in thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which
is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer&rsquo;s
dog bark at a beggar?</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER.<br/>
Ay, sir.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold
the great image of authority: a dog&rsquo;s obeyed in office.<br/>
Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!<br/>
Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;<br/>
Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind<br/>
For which thou whipp&rsquo;st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.<br/>
Through tatter&rsquo;d clothes great vices do appear;<br/>
Robes and furr&rsquo;d gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,<br/>
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;<br/>
Arm it in rags, a pygmy&rsquo;s straw does pierce it.<br/>
None does offend, none, I say none; I&rsquo;ll able &rsquo;em;<br/>
Take that of me, my friend, who have the power<br/>
To seal the accuser&rsquo;s lips. Get thee glass eyes,<br/>
And like a scurvy politician, seem<br/>
To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:<br/>
Pull off my boots: harder, harder, so.

We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.

It were a delicate stratagem to shoe<br/>
A troop of horse with felt. I&rsquo;ll put&rsquo;t in proof<br/>

I am a very foolish fond old man,<br/>
Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;<br/>
And to deal plainly,<br/>
I fear I am not in my perfect mind.<br/>
Methinks I should know you, and know this man;<br/>
Yet I am doubtful: for I am mainly ignorant<br/>
What place this is; and all the skill I have<br/>
Remembers not these garments; nor I know not<br/>
Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;<br/>

To be my child Cordelia.

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray weep not:<br/>
If you have poison for me, I will drink it.<br/>
I know you do not love me; for your sisters<br/>

You have some cause, they have not.

Be comforted, good madam, the great rage,<br/>
You see, is kill&rsquo;d in him: and yet it is danger<br/>
To make him even o&rsquo;er the time he has lost.<br/>
Desire him to go in; trouble him no more<br/>
Till further settling.

My reason all the same; and they are ready<br/>

Rather than die at once!&mdash;taught me to shift<br/>
Into a madman&rsquo;s rags; t&rsquo;assume a semblance<br/>
That very dogs disdain&rsquo;d; and in this habit<br/>
Met I my father with his bleeding rings,<br/>
Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,<br/>
Led him, begg&rsquo;d for him, sav&rsquo;d him from despair;<br/>
Never,&mdash;O fault!&mdash;reveal&rsquo;d myself unto him<br/>
Until some half hour past, when I was arm&rsquo;d;<br/>
Not sure, though hoping of this good success,<br/>
I ask&rsquo;d his blessing, and from first to last<br/>
Told him my pilgrimage. But his flaw&rsquo;d heart,<br/>
Alack, too weak the conflict to support!<br/>
&rsquo;Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,<br/>
Burst smilingly.
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
This speech of yours hath mov&rsquo;d me,<br/>
And shall perchance do good, but speak you on;<br/>
You look as you had something more to say.
</p>

<p>ALBANY.<br/>
If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;<br/>
For I am almost ready to dissolve,<br/>
Hearing of this.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
This would have seem&rsquo;d a period<br/>
To such as love not sorrow; but another,<br/>
To amplify too much, would make much more,<br/>
And top extremity.<br/>
Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man<br/>
Who, having seen me in my worst estate,<br/>
Shunn&rsquo;d my abhorr&rsquo;d society; but then finding<br/>
Who &rsquo;twas that so endur&rsquo;d, with his strong arms<br/>
He fastened on my neck, and bellow&rsquo;d out<br/>
As he&rsquo;d burst heaven; threw him on my father;<br/>
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him<br/>
That ever ear receiv&rsquo;d, which in recounting<br/>
His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life<br/>
Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,<br/>
And there I left him tranc&rsquo;d.
</p>

<p>ALBANY.<br/>
But who was this?
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Kent, sir, the banish&rsquo;d Kent; who in disguise<br/>
Follow&rsquo;d his enemy king and did him service<br/>
Improper for a slave.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter a <span class="charname">Gentleman</span> hastily,
with a bloody knife.</p>

<p>GENTLEMAN.<br/>
Help, help! O, help!
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
What kind of help?
</p>

<p>ALBANY.<br/>
Speak, man.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
What means this bloody knife?
</p>

<p>GENTLEMAN.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis hot, it smokes;<br/>
It came even from the heart of&mdash;O! she&rsquo;s dead!
</p>

<p>ALBANY.<br/>
Who dead? Speak, man.
</p>

<p>GENTLEMAN.<br/>
Your lady, sir, your lady; and her sister<br/>
By her is poisoned; she hath confesses it.
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
I was contracted to them both, all three<br/>
Now marry in an instant.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Here comes Kent.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Kent</span>.</p>

<p>ALBANY.<br/>
Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead.<br/>
This judgement of the heavens that makes us tremble<br/>
Touches us not with pity. O, is this he?<br/>
The time will not allow the compliment<br/>
Which very manners urges.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
I am come<br/>
To bid my King and master aye good night:<br/>
Is he not here?
</p>

<p>ALBANY.<br/>
Great thing of us forgot!<br/>
Speak, Edmund, where&rsquo;s the King? and where&rsquo;s Cordelia?
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> The bodies of <span class="charname">Goneril</span> and
<span class="charname">Regan</span> are brought in.</p>

<p>Seest thou this object, Kent?</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
Alack, why thus?
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
Yet Edmund was belov&rsquo;d.<br/>
The one the other poisoned for my sake,<br/>
And after slew herself.
</p>

<p>ALBANY.<br/>
Even so. Cover their faces.
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
I pant for life. Some good I mean to do,<br/>
Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,<br/>
Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ<br/>
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia;<br/>
Nay, send in time.
</p>

<p>ALBANY.<br/>
Run, run, O, run!
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send<br/>
Thy token of reprieve.
</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
Well thought on: take my sword,<br/>
Give it the captain.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Haste thee for thy life.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Edgar</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>EDMUND.<br/>
He hath commission from thy wife and me<br/>
To hang Cordelia in the prison, and<br/>
To lay the blame upon her own despair,<br/>
That she fordid herself.

<p>ALBANY.<br/>
The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.

Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone.<br/>
Had I your tongues and eyes, I&rsquo;ld use them so<br/>
That heaven&rsquo;s vault should crack. She&rsquo;s gone for ever!<br/>
I know when one is dead, and when one lives;<br/>
She&rsquo;s dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass;<br/>
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,<br/>
Why, then she lives.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
Is this the promis&rsquo;d end?
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Or image of that horror?
</p>

<p>ALBANY.<br/>
Fall, and cease!
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so,<br/>
It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows<br/>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!<br/>
I might have sav&rsquo;d her; now she&rsquo;s gone for ever!<br/>
Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!<br/>
What is&rsquo;t thou say&rsquo;st? Her voice was ever soft,<br/>
Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.<br/>
I kill&rsquo;d the slave that was a-hanging thee.
</p>

<p>OFFICER.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis true, my lords, he did.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Did I not, fellow?<br/>
I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion<br/>
I would have made them skip. I am old now,<br/>
And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?<br/>
Mine eyes are not o&rsquo; the best, I&rsquo;ll tell you straight.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
If Fortune brag of two she lov&rsquo;d and hated,<br/>
One of them we behold.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
The same,<br/>
Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
He&rsquo;s a good fellow, I can tell you that;<br/>
He&rsquo;ll strike, and quickly too:. He&rsquo;s dead and rotten.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
No, my good lord; I am the very man.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll see that straight.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
That from your first of difference and decay<br/>
Have follow&rsquo;d your sad steps.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
You are welcome hither.
</p>

<p>KENT.<br/>
Nor no man else. All&rsquo;s cheerless, dark and deadly.<br/>
Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,<br/>
And desperately are dead.
</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
Ay, so I think.
</p>

<p>ALBANY.<br/>
He knows not what he says; and vain is it<br/>
That we present us to him.
</p>

<p>EDGAR.<br/>
Very bootless.

<p>OFFICER.<br/>
Edmund is dead, my lord.

<p>ALBANY.<br/>
That&rsquo;s but a trifle here.<br/>
You lords and noble friends, know our intent.<br/>
What comfort to this great decay may come<br/>
Shall be applied For us, we will resign,<br/>
During the life of this old majesty,<br/>
To him our absolute power;<br/>
[<i>to Edgar and Kent</i>] you to your rights;<br/>
With boot and such addition as your honours<br/>
Have more than merited. All friends shall taste<br/>
The wages of their virtue and all foes<br/>

</p>

<p>LEAR.<br/>
And my poor fool is hang&rsquo;d! No, no, no life!<br/>
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life,<br/>
And thou no breath at all? Thou&rsquo;lt come no more,<br/>
Never, never, never, never, never!<br/>

He is gone indeed.

The wonder is, he hath endur&rsquo;d so long:<br/>
He but usurp&rsquo;d his life.

Project Gutenberg volunteers

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be
renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so
the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.
Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this
license, apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and
trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be
used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific
permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook,
complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook for nearly
any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances
and research. They may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

you from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating
derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project
Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain
freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and
permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with
the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,
please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including
how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to
our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
